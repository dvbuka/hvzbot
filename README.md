# ðŸ§Ÿ UCD HvZBot ðŸ§Ÿ

## Set up
I used Heroku and a cloud version of MongoDB, Altas, to host this application. Why? It's free and there's ample resources for making a Discord bot using both. When testing, I use .env to fetch the important keys (make sure this is NOT found on your GitHub repository!!!)

The keys needed are:
* DISCORD_TOKEN=[found in the Discord Developer portal]
* MONGODB_SRV=[found on the Atlas site]
* PREFIX=[prefix your bot uses; my choice was "-"]
